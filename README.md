# yamf

## Structure
YAMF files are lrzip files with either lzo or gzip backend. Programs should ideally support both. LZO provides extremely fast compression and decompression, but gzip has a better compression ratio.

WIP

## Templates
Templates are optional, but they are meant to save space! You may be questioning: what's the point of compression then? Templates are more convenient for users, temporary files (folders?) are smaller, and compression/decompression is faster!
